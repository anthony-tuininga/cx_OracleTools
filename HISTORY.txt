Changes from 7.4 to 8.0
 1) In DescribeObject, added option --show-synonyms which enables display of
    synonyms that reference the object. The default value for this option is
    false.
 2) In DescribeObject, DescribeSchema, ExportObjects and RebuildTable, added
    support for Oracle context objects.
 3) In DescribeSchema, ExportObjects and RecompileSource, added option
    --name-file which acts in the same fashion as the --name option except that
    the value of the option refers to a file containing a list of names, one
    name per line.
 4) In DescribeObject, DescribeSchema and ExportObjects, added option
    --include-view-columns which enables specification of the column names
    when creating a view.
 5) In DescribeObject and DescribeSchema added support for eliminating the
    quotas on tablespaces when generating create user statements.
 6) In DescribeObject, DescribeSchema and ExportObjects, added options
    --as-of-timestamp and --as-of-scn which enable flashback queries when
    performing describes. This can be very useful for recovering those
    accidentally issued DDL commands!
 7) In DumpCSV, make use of the builtin module csv and the standard option
    --schema; in addition, allow the file name to be specified as "-" or not
    at all in which case the output goes to stdout.
 8) In DumpData, added support for dumping CLOB, BLOB and binary data values
    correctly. A commit statement is also appended to the output now as a
    convenience.
 9) In ExportXML, added option --sort-by which allows the result set to be
    sorted before exporting. In addition, the source can be a query instead of
    simply a table name.
10) In GeneratePatch, switch to the new more intelligent parser.
11) In ImportXML, now use cElementTree rather than home-grown XML processing
    library.
12) In RebuildTable, removed SQL*Plus specific statements since by default
    connect statements are issued which only works properly with PatchDB.
13) In RecompileSource, added option --connect-as-owner and removed option
    --password. The new option specifies that when invalid objects are
    recompiled that a connection to the owner of the invalid object is
    established using the password of the current connection. The default
    value is false since this is an uncommon situation and is retained at all
    for support of product development at Computronix.
14) Replaced CompileSource with PatchDB which uses a much more advanced parser
    and is setup to handle additional commands besides executing SQL scripts.
15) Added setup.py for building with cx_Freeze.
16) Other changes required to keep up with changes in Python, dependent
    libraries and Oracle (including up to Oracle 11.2).

Changes from 7.3 to 7.4
 1) Use cx_Logging to output messages rather than write directly to stderr.
 2) Added support for describing comments on tables and columns.
 3) Improved output when an exception occurs.
 4) cx_Oracle 4.2 is now required.
 5) Replace use of executemanyprepared() with executemany() and bind arrays
    instead of dictionaries which actually improves performance by about 20-25%
    in some cases.
 6) Moved code from module cx_DumpData in project cx_PyOracleLib into DumpData.
 7) Provide more meaningful message when source or target directory is missing
    in GeneratePatch as requested by Micah Friesen.
 8) Ignore invalid objects of type "UNDEFINED" when describing objects.
 9) Export the roles before the users as the reason the roles are included is
    because they are administered by the users and the grants will by
    definition fail.
10) In ExportObjects, create the directory before any exporting actually takes
    place in order to handle the situation when no objects are exported as
    requested by Micah Friesen.
11) Eliminated identical grants made by different users when describing
    objects.
12) Add phrase "(n% of file)" to the reporting message of ImportData when
    possible as requested by Don Reid.
13) Display something more reasonable when compiling statements that modify
    constraints.

Changes from 7.2 to 7.3
 1) Added ExportXML and ImportXML utilities for importing and exporting data
    from an Oracle database as XML.
 2) Added support in ExportData for limiting the number of rows exported and
    skipping some rows first.
 3) Added support in CopyData for the case where all the columns on the target
    table form the primary key.
 4) Added support for case sensitive tables and column names in CopyData.
 5) Added option --report-point to CopyData which defaults to --commit-point.
 6) Added options --log-file, --log-level and --log-prefix to all of the tools
    and removed --timestamp and --prefix on DbDebugger since the new options
    cover the functionality of the old ones.
 7) Added options --suppress-owner-dir, --include-roles, --include-users,
    --no-related and --no-triggers to ExportObjects.
 8) Added option --sort-by to DumpData to modify the query executed to include
    a sort clause.
 9) Added option --only-if to DescribeSchema and ExportObjects which allows
    for filtering the objects described by a where clause against dba_objects.
10) DbDebugger now displays the time to the microsecond if desired.
11) GeneratePatch now makes sure that owner changes are displayed before
    displaying anything about the objects for that owner that are being
    patched.
12) GeneratePatch now produces consistent results by performing a sort before
    displaying any results.
13) Fixed bug in GeneratePatch parsing grants with the "with grant option"
    specified.
14) Fixed bug in DescribeObject where connect statements were being displayed.

Changes from 7.1 to 7.2
 1) Added new tools ExportColumn and ImportColumn for exporting (importing)
    CLOB and BLOB columns from (into) an Oracle database.
 2) Include package used for debugging.
 3) When using DescribeObject, check if the object with the given name matches
    an object in the database, including case. If the object cannot be found,
    check for an object in the database by converting the argument to
    uppercase. Finally, if the name is not found and is not qualified with a
    schema owner, search the public synonyms for one by that name and describe
    that object instead.
 4) Added feedback to DbDebugger indicating on what database the connection
    has been established and on what pipe name the debugger is listening.
 5) Added optional argument to specify a filename into which to put the output
    created by DescribeObject. This is of particular use on Windows which
    doesn't handle redirection very well, particularly in GUI programs.

Changes for 7.1
 1) First introduced to the public.
